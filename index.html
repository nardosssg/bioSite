            <p>
                My mom's biggest goal in life was to build a loving family and see her children succeed. 
                She always valued hard work and believed that dedication would lead to a good life. 
                From a young age, she dreamed of marrying, raising a family, and creating a happy home. 
                She also aimed to be smart in business, understanding the importance of compromise and patience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>One of her greatest accomplishments is raising a successful and loving family. 
                She worked hard to provide a good life and now feels fulfilled watching her children grow and thrive.
                She takes pride in the life she has built and feels grateful for everything she has achieved.
                To her, true success is finding happiness, love, and taking care of the people who matter most</p>
