            <h1>ABOUT ME </h1>
            <p>My mom was born in Eritrea, where she grew up with dreams of marrying, building a family, and seeing her children thrive.
                As a child, she found joy in the simple things, and her passion has always been her family. She takes comfort in quiet moments, watching her loved ones succeed, which brings her true happiness.
                 Her first job in Eritrea was working on a farm, handling cattle, and learning the value of hard work. She learned through her career and experiences that knowing 
                 when to compromise and being smart in business can take you far. She believes that hard work always leads to something good in the end. When asked about advice for
                  younger people, she emphasized the importance of working hard, being patient, and trusting God. Her greatest passion is her family, and seeing her children grow, 
                  succeed, and find happiness fulfills her the most. Although she doesn’t have a favorite movie or show, she enjoys anything that brings laughter and relaxation. 
                  To her, the purpose of life is to find happiness and love and take care of the people around you. She expressed deep gratitude when reflecting on her life, saying 
                  she has come so far and is happy with how everything has turned out. She feels fulfilled, knowing she has worked hard and is now living the life she had always hoped for.
