                <p>My mom loves cooking and enjoys learning new recipes. 
                She finds joy in blending American and African flavors, creating unique dishes that bring her family together.
                 Experimenting with different ingredients excites her, and she takes pride in making meals that reflect both her
                  Eritrean roots and her life in America.</p>

                <p>My mom loves taking pictures of her kids, meals, and her husband.
                     It’s her way of showing her family back home that we’re doing well, especially since she can’t call often.
                      Each photo captures a special moment, and she feels it helps her stay connected with loved ones, despite the distance.
